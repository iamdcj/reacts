# Data Flow

React promotes one-way data flow in applications; _everything_ goes through a single flow; user input, realtime updates from sever, initial payload.

### Updates

The React engine handles updates in the following ways:

- **Flows**; React Updates components from the top to the bottom of a component tree using the one-way data flow.
- **Trigger**; Prop/State changes trigger an update of the tree from the place where the update occurred.

Render is called when things change, these are then compared and based in the differences a mutated version of the component is created.

#### Updating the DOM

React utilises reconciliation - it keeps the UI fresh by automatically updating the DOM as the data changes.

The `render()` method does not always result in the real DOM being updated - React is clever enough to know when to update the actual DOM

How does it do this?
The Virtual DOM

React has is itâ€™s own DOM, the VDOM,and it uses that to decide when to update the real DOM - this is how it works:

1. RENDER CALL
2. ANALYZES EXISTING VDOM
3. COMPARES AGAINST THE INCOMING VDOM
4. DECIDES ON WHETHER TO UPDATE THE ACTUAL DOM
