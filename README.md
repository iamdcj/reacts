# React

React is a [declarative](https://github.com/iamdcj/javascripts/blob/master/paradigms/README.md#declarative-programming), [component-based](components) [JavaScript](https://github.com/iamdcj/javascripts/) library used for building User Interfaces of all sizes and complexities.

React can be used to deal with only the **'view'** aspect of an application, or in most cases used to engineer fully-fledged single page applications.

### The Benefits of React

- **Scalable**; a great framework for building applications of all sizes.
- **Lightning Fast**; React's DOM abstraction, the [virtual DOM](react-dom), ensures UI updates occur in rapid time.
- **Production Ready**; a dedicated team of engineers ensure the library is ever-evolving and well maintained.
- **Resources Aplenty**; there is an abundance of training material available for engineers of all levels.
