# React

React is a [declarative](https://github.com/iamdcj/javascripts/blob/master/paradigms/README.md#declarative-programming), [component-based](components) [JavaScript](https://github.com/iamdcj/javascripts/) library used for building User Interfaces of all sizes and complexities.

React can be used to deal with only the **'view'** aspect of an application, or in most cases used to engineer fully-fledged single page applications.

### The Benefits of React

React provides a scalable framework for building applications of all sizes. It ships with a DOM, the [virtual DOM](react-dom), which ensures UI updates are lightning fast.

It is maintained by a dedicated team of developers at Facebook, with an abundance of training and learning resources to aid application development.
