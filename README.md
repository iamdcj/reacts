# React

React is a [declarative](https://github.com/iamdcj/javascripts/blob/master/paradigms/README.md#declarative-programming), [component-based](components) [JavaScript](https://github.com/iamdcj/javascripts/) library used for building User Interfaces of all sizes and complexities. 

React can be used to deal with only the 'view' aspect of an application, or in most cases used to engineer fully-fledged single page applications.

### The Benefits of React

React provides a scalable framework for building applications of all sizes. It ships with a DOM abstraction which ensures UI updates are lightning fast.

It is maintained by a dedicated team of developers at Facebook, with an abundance of training and learning resources to aid application development.
