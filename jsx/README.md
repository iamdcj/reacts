### Separation of Concerns

The idea of separating all concerns into different files goes against React's ideology, instead it embraces separating concerns into components, which each component handling the structure and functionality in one component, resulting in;

**JSX components containing both the markup, and the logic for a particular abstraction**.

#### Styles

JSX can easily contain any styles needed for the component's presentation directly in the file, resulting in all component concerns living in one file, however the styles are usually placed in a separate file.
