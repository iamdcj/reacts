# JSX

JSX is an extension of regular JavaScript, which allows engineers to code UI components, but with the added benefit of possessing the full power of JS.

JSX components contain both the markup, and the logic for a particular abstraction, i.e. each UI component's structure and functionality can be handled in one component file.
